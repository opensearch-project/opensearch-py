        Returns a list of tasks.


        :arg actions: A comma-separated list of actions that should be
            returned. Keep empty to return all.
        :arg detailed: When `true`, the response includes detailed
            information about shard recoveries. Default is false.
        :arg error_trace: Whether to include the stack trace of returned
            errors. Default is false.
        :arg filter_path: Used to reduce the response. This parameter
            takes a comma-separated list of filters. It supports using wildcards to
            match any field or part of a field’s name. You can also exclude fields
            with "-".
        :arg group_by: Groups tasks by parent/child relationships or
            nodes. Valid choices are nodes, none, parents.
        :arg human: Whether to return human readable values for
            statistics. Default is True.
        :arg nodes: A comma-separated list of node IDs or names used to
            limit the returned information. Use `_local` to return information from
            the node you're connecting to, specify the node name to get information
            from a specific node, or keep the parameter empty to get information
            from all nodes.
        :arg parent_task_id: Returns tasks with a specified parent task
            ID (`node_id:task_number`). Keep empty or set to -1 to return all.
        :arg pretty: Whether to pretty format the returned JSON
            response. Default is false.
        :arg source: The URL-encoded request definition. Useful for
            libraries that do not accept a request body for non-POST requests.
        :arg timeout: The amount of time to wait for a response.
        :arg wait_for_completion: Waits for the matching task to
            complete. When `true`, the request is blocked until the task has
            completed. Default is false.
