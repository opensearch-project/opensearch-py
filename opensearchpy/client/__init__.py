class OpenSearch(Client):
    """
    OpenSearch client. Provides a straightforward mapping from
    Python to OpenSearch REST endpoints.

    The instance has attributes ``cat``, ``cluster``, ``indices``, ``ingest``,
    ``nodes``, ``snapshot`` and ``tasks`` that provide access to instances of
    :class:`~opensearchpy.client.CatClient`,
    :class:`~opensearchpy.client.ClusterClient`,
    :class:`~opensearchpy.client.IndicesClient`,
    :class:`~opensearchpy.client.IngestClient`,
    :class:`~opensearchpy.client.NodesClient`,
    :class:`~opensearchpy.client.SnapshotClient` and
    :class:`~opensearchpy.client.TasksClient` respectively. This is the
    preferred (and only supported) way to get access to those classes and their
    methods.

    You can specify your own connection class which should be used by providing
    the ``connection_class`` parameter::

        # create connection to localhost using the ThriftConnection
        client = OpenSearch(connection_class=ThriftConnection)

    If you want to turn on sniffing you have several options (described
    in :class:`~opensearchpy.Transport`)::

        # create connection that will automatically inspect the cluster to get
        # the list of active nodes. Start with nodes running on
        # 'opensearchnode1' and 'opensearchnode2'
        client = OpenSearch(
            ['opensearchnode1', 'opensearchnode2'],
            # sniff before doing anything
            sniff_on_start=True,
            # refresh nodes after a node fails to respond
            sniff_on_connection_fail=True,
            # and also every 60 seconds
            sniffer_timeout=60
        )

    Different hosts can have different parameters, use a dictionary per node to
    specify those::

        # connect to localhost directly and another node using SSL on port 443
        # and an url_prefix. Note that ``port`` needs to be an int.
        client = OpenSearch([
            {'host': 'localhost'},
            {'host': 'othernode', 'port': 443, 'url_prefix': 'opensearch', 'use_ssl': True},
        ])

    If using SSL, there are several parameters that control how we deal with
    certificates (see :class:`~opensearchpy.Urllib3HttpConnection` for
    detailed description of the options)::

        client = OpenSearch(
            ['localhost:443', 'other_host:443'],
            # turn on SSL
            use_ssl=True,
            # make sure we verify SSL certificates
            verify_certs=True,
            # provide a path to CA certs on disk
            ca_certs='/path/to/CA_certs'
        )

    If using SSL, but don't verify the certs, a warning message is showed
    optionally (see :class:`~opensearchpy.Urllib3HttpConnection` for
    detailed description of the options)::

        client = OpenSearch(
            ['localhost:443', 'other_host:443'],
            # turn on SSL
            use_ssl=True,
            # no verify SSL certificates
            verify_certs=False,
            # don't show warnings about ssl certs verification
            ssl_show_warn=False
        )

    SSL client authentication is supported
    (see :class:`~opensearchpy.Urllib3HttpConnection` for
    detailed description of the options)::

        client = OpenSearch(
            ['localhost:443', 'other_host:443'],
            # turn on SSL
            use_ssl=True,
            # make sure we verify SSL certificates
            verify_certs=True,
            # provide a path to CA certs on disk
            ca_certs='/path/to/CA_certs',
            # PEM formatted SSL client certificate
            client_cert='/path/to/clientcert.pem',
            # PEM formatted SSL client key
            client_key='/path/to/clientkey.pem'
        )

    Alternatively you can use RFC-1738 formatted URLs, as long as they are not
    in conflict with other options::

        client = OpenSearch(
            [
                'http://user:secret@localhost:9200/',
                'https://user:secret@other_host:443/production'
            ],
            verify_certs=True
        )

    By default, `JSONSerializer
    <https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-py/blob/master/opensearch/serializer.py#L24>`_
    is used to encode all outgoing requests.
    However, you can implement your own custom serializer::

        from opensearchpy.serializer import JSONSerializer

        class SetEncoder(JSONSerializer):
            def default(self, obj):
                if isinstance(obj, set):
                    return list(obj)
                if isinstance(obj, Something):
                    return 'CustomSomethingRepresentation'
                return JSONSerializer.default(self, obj)

        client = OpenSearch(serializer=SetEncoder())

        for example to pick up a mapping change.


        :arg index: Comma-separated list of indices; use `_all` or empty
            string to perform the operation on all indices.
        :arg body: The search definition using the Query DSL

            or a list of fields to return.
        :arg _source_excludes: List of fields to exclude from the
            returned _source field.
        :arg _source_includes: List of fields to extract and return from
            the _source field.
        :arg allow_no_indices: Whether to ignore if a wildcard indices
            expression resolves into no concrete indices. (This includes `_all`
            string or when no indices have been specified).
        :arg analyze_wildcard: Specify whether wildcard and prefix
            queries should be analyzed. Default is false.

            conflicts?. Valid choices are abort, proceed.

            concrete indices that are open, closed or both. Valid choices are all,
            open, closed, hidden, none.

        :arg ignore_unavailable: Whether specified concrete indices
            should be ignored when unavailable (missing or closed).

            all documents).
        :arg pipeline: The pipeline id to preprocess incoming documents
            with.

            this request or not, defaults to index level setting.
        :arg requests_per_second: The throttle for this request in sub-
            requests per second. -1 means no throttle. Default is 0.

        :arg scroll: Specify how long a consistent view of the index
            should be maintained for scrolled search.
        :arg scroll_size: Size on the scroll request powering the

        :arg size: Deprecated, please use `max_docs` instead.
        :arg slices: The number of slices this task should be divided
            into. Defaults to 1, meaning the task isn't sliced into subtasks. Can be
            set to `auto`. Default is 1.
        :arg sort: Comma-separated list of <field>:<direction> pairs.
        :arg stats: Specific 'tag' of the request for logging and

            shards that are unavailable. Default is 1m.
        :arg version: Whether to return document version as part of a
            hit.
        :arg wait_for_active_shards: Sets the number of shard copies
            that must be active before proceeding with the operation. Defaults to 1,
            meaning the primary shard only. Set to `all` for all shard copies,
            otherwise set to any non-negative value less than or equal to the total
