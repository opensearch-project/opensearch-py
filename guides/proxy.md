# Using a Proxy

## Using a Proxy with a Sync Client

```python
from opensearchpy import OpenSearch, RequestsHttpConnection

OpenSearch(
    hosts=["https://..."],
    use_ssl=True,
    verify_certs=True,
    connection_class=RequestsHttpConnection,
    trust_env=True,
)
```

## Using a Proxy with an Async Client

```python
from opensearchpy import AsyncOpenSearch, AIOHttpConnection

client = AsyncOpenSearch(
    hosts=["https://..."],
    use_ssl=True,
    verify_certs=True,
    connection_class=AIOHttpConnection,
    trust_env=True,
)
