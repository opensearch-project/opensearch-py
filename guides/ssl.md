# SSL

## Establishing a Secure Connection

```python
from opensearchpy import OpenSearch

host = 'localhost'
port = 9200
auth = ('admin', 'admin') # For testing only. Don't store credentials in code.

# Provide a CA bundle if you use intermediate CAs with your root CA.
# If this is not given, the CA bundle is discovered from the first available
# following options:
# - OpenSSL environment variables SSL_CERT_FILE and SSL_CERT_DIR
# - certifi bundle (https://pypi.org/project/certifi/)
# - default behavior of the connection backend (most likely system certs)
ca_certs_path = '/full/path/to/root-ca.pem'

# Optional client certificates if you don't want to use HTTP basic authentication.
# client_cert_path = '/full/path/to/client.pem'
# client_key_path = '/full/path/to/client-key.pem'

# Create the client with SSL/TLS enabled
client = OpenSearch(
    hosts = [{'host': host, 'port': port}],
    http_compress = True, # enables gzip compression for request bodies
    http_auth = auth,
    # client_cert = client_cert_path,
    # client_key = client_key_path,
    use_ssl = True,
    verify_certs = True,
    ssl_assert_hostname = False, # Hostname verification is disabled here, but by default, it will remain enabled.
    ssl_show_warn = False,
    ca_certs = ca_certs_path
)
```
When `ssl_assert_hostname` is set to None, verification is conducted using server hostname, effectively equivalent to not setting ssl_assert_hostname.


## Verifying SSL against a different host

When the server youâ€™re connecting to presents a different certificate than the hostname, you can use ssl_assert_hostname:

```python
from opensearchpy import OpenSearch

host = 'localhost'
port = 9200
auth = ('admin', 'admin')
ca_certs_path = '/full/path/to/root-ca.pem'

client = OpenSearch(
    hosts = [{'host': host, 'port': port}],
    http_compress = True, 
    http_auth = auth,
    use_ssl = True,
    verify_certs = True,
    ssl_assert_hostname = "ssl.com", # Indicate the host name to assert against. By default, it is equal to the server hostname.
    ssl_show_warn = False,
    ca_certs = ca_certs_path
)
```
