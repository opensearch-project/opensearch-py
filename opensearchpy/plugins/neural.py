        :arg node_id: Comma-separated list of node IDs or names to limit
            the returned information; leave empty to get information from all nodes.
        :arg stat: Comma-separated list of stats to retrieve; use empty
            string to retrieve all stats.
        :arg error_trace: Whether to include the stack trace of returned
            errors. Default is false.
        :arg filter_path: Used to reduce the response. This parameter
            takes a comma-separated list of filters. It supports using wildcards to
            match any field or part of a fieldâ€™s name. You can also exclude fields
            with "-".
        :arg flat_stat_paths: Whether to return stats in the flat form,
            which can improve readability, especially for heavily nested stats. For
            example, the flat form of `"processors": { "ingest": {
            "text_embedding_executions": 20181212 } }` is
            `"processors.ingest.text_embedding_executions": "20181212"`. Default is
            false.
        :arg human: Whether to return human readable values for
            statistics. Default is True.
        :arg include_metadata: Whether to return stat metadata instead
            of the raw stat value, includes additional information about the stat.
            These can include things like type hints, time since last stats being
            recorded, or recent rolling interval values Default is false.
        :arg pretty: Whether to pretty format the returned JSON
            response. Default is false.
        :arg source: The URL-encoded request definition. Useful for
            libraries that do not accept a request body for non-POST requests.
